## spatula app

Description:
spatula is an app designed to look up recipes that return the user back a list of recipes with their images and descriptions. Users can then click on the image to check the instructions, ingredients and equipment necessary, and nutrition facts of the recipe. I wanted to create this app since I enjoy cooking, and I often have trouble deciding what to cook. The app is using api data from [spoonacular](https://spoonacular.com/food-api).
